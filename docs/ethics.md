# Ethical Implications

With the usage of AI, the discussion of ethics is never far off. This guide is not intended to recommend you on how to ethically use LLMs or other forms of artificial intelligence, but this section will inform you on some basic ideals/practices to keep in mind when using AI/LLMs.

## Never share sensitive/personal information

This is a pretty standard rule of the internet. LLMs commonly use their users' conversations for training purposes, so it is important to not share sensitive information.

## Information accuracy

Information put out by an LLM is not always correct. Accuracy can vary from slightly wrong to totally misinformed, so it is important to take whatever responses you receive with a grain of salt. Doing your own fact checking can ensure you do not fall victim to incorrect information.

## Sources of training data

The material used to train LLMs can come from a variety of sources, most commonly referred to as "data scraping, a morally and legally dubious way of collecting potentially copyrighted data for a model. When using an LLM, you most likely won't be able to tell where your information is coming from, so it is important to be aware of these issues.

## Environmental concerns

LLMs and data centers need a **lot** of energy to keep running. With the proliferation of AI, more and more energy will be required for upkeep.
