# Data Visualization

>Use cases: Mind maps, charts, diagrams

!!! note
    Ensure the Analysis Tool is enabled to allow Claude to analyze the documents you have submitted.

Claude is able to process and organize data in various formats such as flowcharts and documents. While Artifacts may consist of code skeletons for a user to edit manually, Claude can also interpret given data and return a more detailed code blocks for specific needs.

When prompted, Claude can generate Artifacts in formats such as HTML and SVG, and can also generate code to be used specifically in tools and interfaces such as React and Mermaid. This creates more generic code blocks that can be used for general outlines that are easy to edit and build on, even without prior coding experience.

> Claude can generate code and a preview of its code in its own Artifact preview.

Additionally, when Claude is given custom documentation of details a user would like to include in a diagram, Claude can accurately generate more detailed Artifacts tailored for the information it's given. This is best for users who have denser, more developed ideas to put into code.

> Claude can dissect complicated documentation and format it into a mind map or flowchart as needed
