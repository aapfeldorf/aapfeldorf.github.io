# Document Templates

>Artifact use cases: budget/expenditure reports, resumes, _user guides_

Another feature of Artifacts is its ability to generate document templates. Claude can take any context or information given and integrate it into your desired document. Unfortunately, Claude is not capable of generating Artifacts in the form of Microsoft Word documents (```.docx``` files). They can only be downloaded as Markdown (```.md```), text (```.txt```), or PDF (```.pdf```) files. Markdown is an [easy-to-use language for creating formatted text documents](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Resources online can [convert markdown to word documents](https://mconverter.eu/convert/markdown/docx/).

As an example, assume you are an engineering student in college who needs to clean up their resume before applying for summer internships. You have a current resume, but it's a little messy and you aren't really sure how to go about cleaning it up. You ask Claude, "Can you generate a sample resume for an engineering student?" It may spit out an Artifact like this:

This is a great start. The formatting is appealing and the organizational structure is solid. But you aren't Alex Rodriguez and this information isn't representative of you.  To refine the document, you may want to ask something like this: "I like the layout and format, but can you take out the sample information?"

Now you have a blank-slate template with the formatting preserved. From here, you have many options with how to proceed. You can:

* Copy the text and paste it into a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs and work on it from there.
* Ask Claude to fill in certain sections of the resume with the information you provide it (projects, previous employment, skills, etc).
* Continue to change formatting until you are satisfied.
* Download the Artifact as a PDF ready to upload to applicant pages.

In minutes, you generated a usable resume that looks good to employers and can be easily modified. If your application requires it, you could also ask Claude to create a cover-letter template using your resume. This is one of many ways you can use Artifacts and specifically document templates to boost your productivity and assist you in your day-to-day tasks.
